    "Overall Summary\n",
    "Cabrera High School stands out as having the best overall performance. Here are the key reasons:\n",
    "1.\tHigh Average Scores:\n",
    "•\tCabrera High School has the highest average math score (94.13) and average reading score (97.04) among all the schools in the dataset. This indicates consistently strong academic performance across both subjects.\n",
    "2.\tHigh Overall Passing Percentage:\n",
    "•\tThe overall passing percentage at Cabrera High School is 91.33%, which is the highest among the listed schools. This percentage represents the proportion of students who passed both math and reading, reflecting a well-rounded academic achievement.\n",
   
    "Following that, we delve into an examination of the school budget and assess its correlation with academic performance.\n",
    "1.\tBudget and Resource Utilization:\n",
    "•\tSchool budgets vary significantly, ranging from $248,087 at Holden High School to $3,124,928 at Bailey High School. Interestingly, while Bailey High School has the highest budget, its per-student budget is $628, which is relatively lower compared to some other schools. Holden High School, on the other hand, demonstrates efficient resource utilization with a higher per-student budget of $581.\n",
    "2.\tChallenges and Opportunities:\n",
    "•\tHernandez High School faces challenges with a lower overall passing percentage of 53.53%. The school's average math and reading scores are comparatively lower, indicating potential areas for improvement. Understanding the factors influencing these results can help identify opportunities for targeted interventions and support.\n",
    "3.\tDiversity in Student Population:\n",
    "•\tThe dataset reflects diversity in student population sizes, ranging from 427 at Holden High School to 4,976 at Bailey High School. The impact of school size on academic performance may be explored further to understand potential correlations.\n",
    "In conclusion, the analysis provides valuable insights into the academic performance and resource utilization of each school. Further investigation into the factors influencing these metrics can guide educational strategies and interventions to enhance overall student outcomes.\n"
